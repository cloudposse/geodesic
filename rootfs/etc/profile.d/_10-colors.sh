	#
	# Today's bash lesson regarding arrays, associative arrays, and the -v test.
	#
	# It is remarkably hard to safely test weather a variable has been declared as an associative array.
	#
	### Background on indexing arrays in bash
	#
	# In bash, the expression `var[subscript]` has, unfortunately, two very different meanings,
	# depending on whether `var` has been declared as an associative array or not. If `var` has
	# NOT been declared an associative arry, then `subscript` is treated as an arithmetic expression.
	# Within an expression, shell variables may be referenced by name without using the parameter
	# expansion syntax, meaning `subscript` evaluates to `$subscript`, and the value of the variable
	# `$subscript` is treated as an arithmetic expression (subject to recursive expansion), which is expected
	# to yield a number. On the other hand, if `var` has been declared as an associative array, then
	# `subscript` is treated as a string and is used to look up the value associated with that key,
	# with no further interpretation of the string.
	#
	# This means that if `ary` has not been declared as an associative array, the expression
	# `$ary[TERM]` causes $TERM to be evaluated as an arithmetic expression, which, through dumb luck,
	# fails if $TERM is "xterm-256color" because the subscript expression is expanded like this:
	#   $TERM -> xterm-256color            # the value of $TERM
	#   $xterm - 256color -> 0 - 256color  # $xterm is not set, so it is treated as 0
	#   ERROR converting "256color" to an integer: value too great for base
	#
	# If `TERM` had been set to `xterm-256` then the expression would have successfully evaluated to -256.
	#
	### Testing to see if a variable has been declared
	#
	# In bash, the normal way to test if a variable is set is to use the -v test, as in [[ -v varname ]].
	# (Unlike the -z test, -v distinguishes between unset variables and variables set to the empty string.)
	# However, with arrays, -v tests if the given index is set. If `ary` is an array, associative or not,
	# [[ -v ary ]] is treated as [[ -v ary[0] ]] and is only true of that specific index (zero) has been assigned
	# a value. So for our purposes, we cannot use -v to test if `_geodesic_tput_cache` has been declared
	# but not initialized unless we do something like ensure that `_geodesic_tput_cache[0]` is always set.
	# While it would be relatively easy to ensure that `_geodesic_tput_cache[0]` is always set, it would
	# leave a very mistaken impression of what the [[ -v _geodesic_tput_cache ]] test is actually doing
	# and why it works. Since this is open source code, we want to set a better example.
	#
	### Testing to see if a variable has been declared as an associative array
	#
	# Starting with Bash version 5, parameter operators are available, in the form of ${parameter@operator}.
	# The "a" operator expands the expression into a string consisting of flag values representing parameterâ€™s attributes.
	# For an associative array, the "a" operator expands to "A". For a plain array, it expands to "a".
	# Note that other attributes are possible, too. For example, an exported non-associative array expands to "ax".
	# This gives us a better solution. We can test if _geodesic_tput_cache has been declared as an associative
	# array by using [[ ${_geodesic_tput_cache@a} == "A" ]]. By putting this test first, we can short-circuit
	# the evaluation of `${_geodesic_tput_cache[TERM]}` and avoid the arithmetic evaluation error.
	#

	if [[ ${_geodesic_tput_cache@a} != "A" ]] || [[ "${_geodesic_tput_cache[TERM]}" != "$TERM" ]]; then

}

# Named style helpers
#
# For each color there is "color" and "bold-color", where "bold-color" is the bold version of the color.
#
# These come in 2 flavors.
# - The plain ones include a newline in the end and do not include delimiters around the non-printing text.
# - The ones ending with "-n" do not include a newline and do include delimiters around the non-printing text.
#
# Note that the newline is stripped if run via command substitution, so
#   echo "$(red "Hello") World"
# will not have a newline between "Hello" and "World".
# However, you should still use the "-n" variants if your string is or might become part of a PS1 prompt.
# Otherwise, bash will not correctly calculate the visible length of the prompt and editing command history will break.
#
# We intentionally do not define blue or magenta, as blue is problematic in dark mode
# and magenta is too much like red in dark mode, plus it is used as a substitute for yellow in light mode.
# We do not define white or black, either, as we should use the terminal's default for those.
# However, those colors are available via _geodesic_color() if needed, and "white" and "black" are
# swapped in dark mode, so they are more appropriately called "bg" and "fg" respectively.
# Also, "yellow" is not necessarily yellow, it varies with the terminal theme, and
# would be better named "caution" or "info".
