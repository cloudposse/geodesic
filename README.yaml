  Geodesic is the fastest way to get up and running with a rock solid, production grade cloud platform built entirely from Open Source technologies.

  Itâ€™s a swiss army knife for creating and building consistent platforms to be shared across a team environment.

  It easily versions staging environments in a repeatable manner that can be followed by any team member.

  It provides a fully customizable framework for defining and building world-class cloud infrastructures backed by [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and powered by [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). It couples best-of-breed technologies with engineering best-practices to equip organizations with the tooling that enables clusters to be spun up in record time without compromising security.
