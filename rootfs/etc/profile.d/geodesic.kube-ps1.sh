# A little extra help for https://github.com/jonmosco/kube-ps1

# As of kube-ps1 v0.8.0 we can limit customizations to the cluster name function
#PROMPT_HOOKS+=("kube_ps1_helper")
## kube-ps1 v0.7.0 is better about detecting changes,
## so we can ease up on the help. Also, setting KUBE_PS1_CONTEXT to an
## empty string hides the prompt without disabling it, so we use that
## rather than kubeoff so we do not have to detect when to run kubeon
