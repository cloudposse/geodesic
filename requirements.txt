# Version tracking update
# awscli 1.16.209, awsebcli 3.15.3 require PyYAML >=3.10 <=3.13
# and awsebcli also depends on python docker-compose >= 1.23.2, < 1.24.0
# which has a similar requirement.
# awscli 1.16.226 allows PyYAML <= 5.2
#
# Unfortunately as of 2019-08-26
# * Current awsebcli==3.15.3 requires PyYAML >=3.10 <=3.13 and
#   docker-compose >= 1.23.2, < 1.24.0 which also requires PyYAML >=3.10 <=3.13
# * Current docker-compose=1.24.1 requires PyYAML >= 3.10, < 4.3
#   and the team does not want to upgrade to PyYAML 5.x until 5.2 is out
#   See https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/6619
#
# Until awsebcli supports PyYAML 5.x, we are pinning it to 3.13
