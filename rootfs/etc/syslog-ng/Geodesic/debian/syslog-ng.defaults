########## GEODESIC NOTE ###############
# While this is the standard file to set
# defaults for syslog-ng under Debian,
# GEODESIC does not use init.d or systemctl
# to run syslog-ng, so this file is not
# actually used. Options are configured
# in the script that starts syslog-ng,
# which is /etc/profile.d/syslog-ng.sh

# log level of messages which should go to console
# see syslog(3) for details
#
#CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL=1

# Command line options to syslog-ng
