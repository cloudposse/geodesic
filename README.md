![Geodesic](docs/geodesic-small.png)

Geodesic is the fastest way to get up and running with a rock solid, production grade cloud platform built entirely from Open Source technologies. 

It’s a swiss army knife for creating and building consistent platforms to be shared across a team environment.

It easily versions staging environments in a repeatable manner that can be followed by any team member.

It's a way of doing things that allows companies to collaborate on infrastructure (~snowflakes~) and radically reduce Total Cost of Ownership, along with a vibrant and active [slack community](https://slack.cloudposse.com).

It provides a fully customizable framework for defining and building cloud infrastructures backed by [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and powered by [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). It couples best-of-breed technologies with engineering best-practices to equip organizations with the tooling that enables clusters to be spun up in record time without compromising security. 

It's works natively with Mac OSX, Linux, and [Windows 10 (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

## Introduction

These days, the typical software application is distributed as a docker image and run as a container. Why should infrastructure be any different? Since everything we write is "Infrastructure as Code", we believe that it should be treated the same way. This is the "Geodesic Way". Use containers+envs instead of unconventional wrappers, complicated folder structures and symlink hacks. Geodesic is the container for all your infrastructure automation needs that enables you to truly achieve SweetOps.

Geodesic is composed of two parts:

  1. It is an interactive command-line shell. The shell includes the *ultimate* mashup of cloud orchestration tools. Those tools are then integrated to work in concert with each other using a consistent framework. Installation of the shell is as easy as running a docker container.  
  2. It is a distribution of essential services and [reference architectures](https://github.com/cloudposse?q=cloudposse.co). The distribution includes a collection of [100+ Free Terraform Modules](https://github.com/cloudposse?q=terraform-) and their [invocations](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-root-modules), dozens of preconfigured [Helmfiles](https://github.com/cloudposse/helmfiles), [Helm charts](https://github.com/cloudposse/charts) for CI/CD, VPN, SSH Bastion, Automatic DNS, Automatic TLS, Automatic Monitoring, Account Management, Log Collection, Load Balancing/Routing, Image Serving, and much more. What makes these charts even more valuable is that they were designed from the ground up to work well with each other and integrate with external services for authentication (SSO/OAuth2, MFA).

An organization may chose to leverage all of these components, or just the parts that make their life easier.
We recommend starting by using `geodesic` as a Docker base image (e.g. `FROM cloudposse/geodesic:...` pinned to a release) in your projects.

Let's roll...

1. Review our [documentation](https://docs.cloudposse.com/geodesic/)
2. Check our [reference architectures](https://docs.cloudposse.com/reference-architectures/) to learn how we architect the infrastructure
3. Use our [coldstart automation](https://github.com/cloudposse/reference-architectures) to get started quickly
4. Quickly provision [kops clusters](docs/kops.md)

* **OpenSource** - Permissive [APACHE 2.0](LICENSE) license means no lock-in and no on-going license fees

## TECHNOLOGIES

At its core, Geodesic is a framework for provisioning cloud infrastructure and the applications that sit on top of it. We leverage as many existing tools as possible to facilitate cloud fabrication and administration. We're like the connective tissue that sits between all of the components of a modern cloud.

* [`atlantis`](https://www.runatlantis.io/) - GitOps style operations by Pull Request. Ideal for terraform, helm and helmfile.
* [`aws-vault`](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault) for securely storing and accessing AWS credentials in an encrypted vault for the purpose of assuming IAM roles
* [`aws-cli`](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/) for interacting directly with the AWS APIs
* [`chamber`](https://github.com/segmentio/chamber) for managing secrets with AWS SSM+KMS and exposing them as environment variables
* [`direnv`](https://direnv.net) for managing environment variables per project or globally
* [`helm`](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/) for installing packages like Varnish or Apache on the Kubernetes cluster
* [`helmfile`](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile) for 12-factorizing chart values and installing chart collections
* [`kops`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/) for Kubernetes cluster orchestration
* [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl-overview/) for controlling kubernetes resources like deployments or load balancers
* [`gcloud`, `gsutil`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) for integration with Google Cloud (e.g. GKE, GCE, Google Storage)
* [`gomplate`](https://github.com/hairyhenderson/gomplate/) for template rendering configuration files using the GoLang template engine. Supports lots of local and remote datasources
* [`goofys`](https://github.com/kahing/goofys/) a high-performance Amazon S3 file system for mounting encrypted S3 buckets that store cluster configurations and secrets
* [`terraform`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/) for provisioning miscellaneous resources on pretty much any cloud
* [`tmate`](https://tmate.io) for remote terminal sharing with other engineers (pairing) and collaborative debugging

## NAME

logo - Explanation of the Geodesic Logo

## SYNOPSIS

![Geodesic Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudposse/geodesic/master/docs/geodesic-small.png)

In mathematics, a geodesic line is the shortest distance between two points on a sphere. It's also a solid structure composed of geometric shapes such as hexagons.

## DESCRIPTION

We like to think of geodesic as the shortest path to a rock-solid cloud infrastructure. The geodesic logo is a hexagon with a cube suspended at its center. The cube represents this geodesic container, which is central to everything and at the same time is what ties everything together.

But look a little closer and you’ll notice there’s much more to it. It's also an isometric shape of a cube with a missing piece. This represents its pluggable design, which lets anyone extend it to suit their vision.
