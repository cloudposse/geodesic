![Geodesic](docs/geodesic-small.png)

Geodesic is the fastest way to get up and running with a rock solid, production grade cloud platform built entirely from Open Source technologies. 

It’s a swiss army knife for creating and building consistent platforms to be shared across a team environment.

It easily versions staging environments in a repeatable manner that can be followed by any team member.

It's a way of doing things that allows companies to collaborate on infrastructure (~snowflakes~) and radically reduce Total Cost of Ownership, along with a vibrant and active [slack community](https://slack.cloudposse.com).

It provides a fully customizable framework for defining and building cloud infrastructures backed by [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and powered by [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). It couples best-of-breed technologies with engineering best-practices to equip organizations with the tooling that enables clusters to be spun up in record time without compromising security. 

It's works natively with Mac OSX, Linux, and [Windows 10 (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

## Introduction

These days, the typical software application is distributed as a docker image and run as a container. Why should infrastructure be any different? Since everything we write is "Infrastructure as Code", we believe that it should be treated the same way. This is the "Geodesic Way". Use containers+envs instead of unconventional wrappers, complicated folder structures and symlink hacks. Geodesic is the container for all your infrastructure automation needs that enables you to truly achieve SweetOps.

Geodesic is composed of two parts:

  1. It is an interactive command-line shell. The shell includes the *ultimate* mashup of cloud orchestration tools.
  Those tools are then integrated to work in concert with each other using a consistent framework.
  Installation of the shell is as easy as running a docker container.
  2. It is a distribution of essential services and reference architectures. The distribution includes a collection of [100+ Free Terraform Modules](https://github.com/cloudposse?q=terraform-) and their [invocations](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components), dozens of preconfigured [Helmfiles](https://github.com/cloudposse/helmfiles), [Helm charts](https://github.com/cloudposse/charts) for CI/CD, VPN, SSH Bastion, Automatic DNS, Automatic TLS, Automatic Monitoring, Account Management, Log Collection, Load Balancing/Routing, Image Serving, and much more. What makes these charts even more valuable is that they were designed from the ground up to work well with each other and integrate with external services for authentication (SSO/OAuth2, MFA).

An organization may chose to leverage all of these components, or just the parts that make their life easier.
We recommend starting by using `geodesic` as a Docker base image (e.g. `FROM cloudposse/geodesic:...` pinned to a release and base OS) in your projects.

**Note**: Starting with Geodesic version 0.138.0, we distribute 2 versions of Geodesic Docker images, one based on [Alpine](https://alpinelinux.org/)
and one based on [Debian](https://debian.org), tagged `VERSION-BASE_OS`, e.g. `0.138.0-alpine`.
Prior to this, all Docker images were based on Alpine only and simply tagged `VERSION`. At present, the Alpine version is the most thoroughly tested
and best supported version, and the special Docker tag `latest` will continue to point to the latest Alpine version while this
remains the case. However, we encourage people to use the Debian version and report any issues by opening a GitHub issue,
so that we may eventually make it the preferred version, after which point the `latest` tag will point to latest Debian image. We
will maintain the `latest-alpine` and `latest-debian` Docker tags for those who want to commit to using one base OS or
the other but still want automatic updates.

Let's roll...

1. Review our [documentation](https://docs.cloudposse.com/geodesic/)
2. Check our [reference architectures](https://docs.cloudposse.com/reference-architectures/) to learn how we architect the infrastructure
3. Use our [coldstart automation](https://github.com/cloudposse/reference-architectures) to get started quickly
4. Quickly provision [kops clusters](docs/kops.md)

## Usage



### Customizing your Docker image

In general we recommend creating a customized version of Geodesic by creating your own Dockerfile starting with
```
ARG VERSION=0.138.0
ARG OS=debian
FROM cloudposse/geodesic:$VERSION-$OS

# Add configuration options such as setting a custom BANNER,
# turning on built-in support for aws-vault or aws-okta,
# setting kops configuration parameters, etc. here

ENV BANNER="my-custom-geodesic"
```
You can see some example configuration options to include in [Dockerfile.options](./Dockerfile.options).

You can also add extra commands by installing "packages". Both Alpine and Debian have a large selection
of packages to choose from. Cloud Posse also provides a large set of packages for installing common DevOps commands
and utilities via [cloudposse/packages](https://github.com/cloudposse/packages).
The package repositories are pre-installed in Geodesic, all you need to do is add the packages you want
via `RUN` commands in your Dockerfile.

#### Installing packages in Alpine

Under Alpine, you install a package by specifying a package name and a repository label (if not the default repository).
(You can also specify a version, see [the Alpine documentation](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux_package_management#Advanced_APK_Usage)
for details). In addition to the default package repository, Geodesic installs 3 others:

| Repository Label | Repository Name|
|------------------|----------------|
| @testing | edge/testing |
| @community | edge/community |
| @cloudposse | cloudposse/packages |

As always, because of Docker layer caching, you should start your command line by updating the repo indexes,
and then add your packages. Alpine uses [`apk`](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux_package_management).
So, to install [Teleport](https://gravitational.com/teleport) support from the Cloud Posse package repository,
pinned to version 4.2.x (which is the last to support Alpine), we can add this to our Dockerfile:

```
RUN apk update && apk add -u teleport@cloudposse=~4.2
```

#### Installing packages in Debian

Debian uses [`apt`](https://wiki.debian.org/Apt) for package management and we generally recommend using
the [`apt-get`](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-guide/ch2.en.html) command to install packages.
In addition to the default repositories, Geodesic pre-installs the Cloud Posse [package](https://github.com/cloudposse/packages) repository
and the Google Cloud SDK package repository. Unlike with `apk`, you do not need to specify a package repository when
installing a package because all repositories will be searched for it.
Also unlike `apk`, `apt-get` does not let you specify a version range on the command line, only an exact version.
So to install the Google Cloud SDK at a specific version, you need to include a trailing `-0` to indicate
the package version. For example, to install version Google Cloud SDK 300.0.0:

```
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y google-cloud-sdk=300.0.0-0
```

Note the `-y` flag to `apt-get install`. That is required for scripted installation, otherwise the command
will ask for confirmation from the keyboard before installing a package.

### Customizing your shell at launch time

After you have build your Docker image, or if you are using a shared Docker image, you can
add further customization at launch time. When Geodesic stars up, it looks for customization
scripts and configuration so you can do things like add command aliases or override preconfigured options.
Detailed information is below, and also available from within the shell via `man customization`.

## NAME

Customization - How to customize Geodesic at launch time

## SYNOPSIS
 
Several features of Geodesic can be customized at launch time (rather than
during the build of the Docker image) so that people can share an image
yet still have things set up the way they like. This document describes
how to configure the customization.

## DESCRIPTION

Users can place bash shell scripts on their host computer, to be read either at the start of `bash` profile 
script processing or at the end of it. These shell scripts can set up environment variables, command
aliases, shell functions, etc. and through setting environment variables, can cause Geodesic to 
enable or disable certain features.

Users can also choose whether to have a single `bash` history file 
for all containers or to have separate history files.

### Root directory for configuration 

All configuration files are stored under `$GEODESIC_CONFIG_HOME`, which defaults to `/localhost/.geodesic`. 
At this time, `/localhost` is mapped to the host `$HOME` directory and this cannot be configured yet, 
so all configuration files must be under `$HOME`, but within that limitation they can be placed anywhere. 
So if you set `$GEODESIC_CONFIG_HOME` to `/localhost/work/config/geodesic`, 
then files would go in `~/work/config/geodesic/` and below on your Docker host machine.

### Resources

There are currently 3 Resources used for configuration:
- Preferences, which are shell scripts loaded very early in the launch of the Geodesic shell. 
- Overrides, which are shell scripts loaded very late in the launch of the Geodesic shell.
- `bash` history files, which store `bash` command line history.

Additionally, when Geodesic exits normally, it will run the host command `geodesic_on_exit`
if it is available. This is intended to be a script that you write and install
anywhere on your PATH to do whatever cleanup you want. For example, change the window title.

Both preferences and overrides can be either a single file, named `preferences` and `overrides` respectively, 
or can be a collection of files in directories named `preferences.d` and `overrides.d`. 
If they are directories, all the visible files in the directories will be sourced, 
except for hidden files and files with names matching the `GEODESIC_AUTO_LOAD_EXCLUSIONS` regex, 
which defaults to `(~|.bak|.log|.old|.orig|.disabled)$`. 

`bash` history is always stored in a single file named `history`, never a directory of files
nor files with any other name. If you want to use a separate history file for one
Geodesic-based Docker image not shared by other Geodesic-based Docker images, you 
must create an empty `history` file in the image-specific configuration directory (see below).

### Configuration by file placement
Resources can be in several places, and will be loaded from most general to most specific, according to the name of the docker container image. 

- The most general resources are the ones directly in `$GEODESIC_CONFIG_HOME`. These are applied first. To keep the top-level directory less cluttered and to avoid name clashes, you can put them in a subdirectory named `defaults`. If that subdirectory exists, then `GEODESIC_CONFIG_HOME ` itself is not searched.
- The `DOCKER_IMAGE` name is then parsed. Everything before the final `/` is considered the "company" name and everything after is, following the Cloudposse reference architecture, referred to as the "stage" name. So for the `DOCKER_IMAGE` name `cloudposse/geodesic`, the company name is `cloudposse` and the stage name is `geodesic`
- The next place searched for resources is the directory with the same name as the "stage", which is generally the name of the project. In our example, that would be `~/.geodesic/geodesic`. Resources here would apply to all containers with the same base name, perhaps various forks of the same project.
- The final place searched is the directory with the full name of the Docker image: `$GEODESIC_CONFIG_HOME/$DOCKER_IMAGE`, 
i.e. `~/.geodesic/cloudposse/geodesic`. Files here are the most specific to this container. 

By loading them in this order, you can put your defaults at one level and then override/customize them at another, minimizing the amount of duplication needed to customize a wide range of containers. 

### Usage details
Preferences and Overrides are loaded in the order specified above and all that are found are loaded. 
For history files, only the last one found is used. To start keeping separate history, 
just create an empty history file in the appropriate place. 

While Preferences and Override files themselves must be `bash` scripts and will be directly loaded into 
the top-level Geodesic shell, they can of course call other programs. 
You can even use them to pull configuration out of other places.

Symbolic links must be relative if you want them to work both inside Geodesic and outside of it. 
Symbolic links that reference directories that are not below `$HOME` on the host will not work.

When possible, Geodesic mounts the host `$HOME` directory as `/localhost` and creates a symbolic link
from `$HOME` to `/localhost` so that files under `$HOME` on the host can be referenced by the 
exact same absolute path both on the host computer and inside Geodesic. For example, if the
host `$HOME` is `/Users/fred`, then `/Users/fred/src/example.sh` will refer to the same file both
on the host and from inside the Geodesic shell. 

In general, you should put most of your customization in the Preferences files. 
Geodesic (usually) takes care to respect and adapt to preferences set before it starts adding on top of them. 
The primary use for overrides is if you need the results of the initialization process as inputs to your configuration, 
or if you need to undo something Geodesic does not yet provide a configuration option for not doing in the first place. 

## WARNING
One of the key benefits of Geodesic is that it provides a consistent environment for all users regardless of their 
local machine. It eliminates the "it works on my machine" excuse. While these customization options can be great 
productivity enhancements as well as provide the opportunity to install new features to try them out before committing 
to installing them permanently, they can also create the kind of divergence in environments that brings back 
the "it works on my machine" problem. 

Therefore, we have included an option to disable the customization files: the preferences, the overrides, 
and the docker environment files. Simply set and export the host environment variable `$GEODESIC_CUSTOMIZATION_DISABLED` 
to any value other than "false" before launching Geodesic.

## TROUBLESHOOTING
If customizations are not being found or are not working as expected, 
you can set the host enviornment variable `$GEODESIC_TRACE` to "custom" before
launching Geodesic and a trace of the customization process will be output
to the console.
