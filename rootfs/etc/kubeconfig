# This is a placeholder Kubernetes configuration file ("kubeconfig") to suppress some warnings.
# We recommend placing kubeconfig files that contain client keys under /dev/shm to reduce the chance of accidental exposure.
# Alternatively, you can use your own configuration from the host's $HOME/.kube/config.
