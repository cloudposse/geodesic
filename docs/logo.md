## NAME

logo - Explanation of the Geodesic Logo

## SYNOPSIS

![Geodesic Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudposse/geodesic/master/docs/geodesic-small.png)

In mathematics, a geodesic line is the shortest distance between two points on a sphere. It's also a solid structure composed of geometric shapes such as hexagons.

## DESCRIPTION

We like to think of geodesic as the shortest path to a rock-solid cloud infrastructure. The geodesic logo is a hexagon with a cube suspended at its center. The cube represents this geodesic container, which is central to everything and at the same time is what ties everything together.

But look a little closer and you’ll notice there’s much more to it. It's also an isometric shape of a cube with a missing piece. This represents its pluggable design, which lets anyone extend it to suit their vision.
