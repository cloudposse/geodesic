## Introduction

Geodesic is the fastest way to get up and running with a rock solid, production grade cloud platform.

It provides a fully customizable framework for defining and building world-class cloud infrastructures backed by [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and powered by [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). It couples best-of-breed technologies with engineering best-practices to equip organizations with the tooling that enables clusters to be spun up in record time without compromising security.

Geodesic is composed of two parts:

1. It is an interactive command-line shell. The shell includes the *ultimate* mashup of cloud orchestration tools. Those tools are then integrated to work in concert with each other using a consistent framework. Installation of the shell is as easy as running a docker container.  
2. It is a distribution of essential services. The distribution includes a collection of Helm charts for CI/CD, VPN, SSH Bastion, Automatic DNS, Automatic TLS,  Automatic Monitoring, Account Management, Log Collection, Load Balancing/Routing, Image Serving, and much more. What makes these charts even more valuable is that they were designed from the ground up to work well with each other and integrate with external services for authentication (SSO/OAuth2, MFA).

An organization may chose to leverage all of these components, or just the parts that make their life easier.

## Features
* **Secure** - TLS/PKI, OAuth2, MFA Everywhere, remote access VPN, [ultra secure bastion/jumphost](https://github.com/cloudposse/bastion) with audit capabilities and slack notifications, [IAM assumed roles](https://github.com/cloudposse/aws-assume-role/), automatic key rotation, encryption at rest, and VPCs
* **Repeatable** - 100% Infrastructure-as-Code with change automation and support for scriptable admin tasks in any language, including Terraform
* **Extensible** - A framework where everything can be extended to work the way you want to
* **Comprehensive** - our [helm charts library](https://github.com/cloudposse/charts) are designed to tightly integrate your cloud-platform with Github Teams and Slack Notifications and CI/CD systems like TravisCI, CircleCI or Jenkins
* **OpenSource** - Permissive [APACHE 2.0](LICENSE) license means no lock-in and no on-going license fees


## Technologies

At its core, Geodesic is a framework for provisioning cloud infrastructure and the applications that sit on top of it. We leverage as many existing tools as possible to facilitate cloud fabrication and administration. We're like the connective tissue that sits between all of the components of a modern cloud.

* [`kops`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/) for Kubernetes cluster orchestration
* [`aws-cli`](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/) for interacting directly with the AWS APIs
* [`helm`](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/) for installing packages like Varnish or Apache on the Kubernetes cluster
* [`terraform`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/) for provisioning miscellaneous resources on pretty much any cloud
* [`packer`](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/) for creating identical machine images for multiple platforms
* [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl-overview/) for controlling kubernetes resources like deployments or load balancers
* [`ansible`](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html) Ansible is an IT automation tool. It can configure systems, deploy software, and orchestrate more advanced IT tasks
* [`gcloud`, `gsutil`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) for integration with Google Cloud (e.g. GKE, GCE, Google Storage)
* [`gomplate`](https://github.com/hairyhenderson/gomplate/) for template rendering configuration files using the GoLang template engine. Supports lots of local and remote datasources
* [`goofys`](https://github.com/kahing/goofys/) a high-performance Amazon S3 file system for mounting encrypted S3 buckets that store cluster configurations and secrets

## Prerequisites

### Install Docker

Docker can be easily installed by following the instructions for your OS:

* [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/linux/step_one/) (Or simply run  `curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh`)
* [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/windows/step_one/)
* [Mac OS](https://docs.docker.com/mac/step_one/)

## Quick Start

1. `export CLUSTER_NAME=test.example.com`

2. Create a new project

   This will create a new project in your current working directory, complete with `Dockerfile` and `Makefile`.

   ```
   docker run -e CLUSTER_NAME \
              -e DOCKER_IMAGE=cloudposse/${CLUSTER_NAME} \
              -e DOCKER_TAG=dev \
              cloudposse/geodesic:latest -c new-project | tar -xv -C .
   ```

2. Customize project as necessary. Edit the `Dockerfile` to reflect your settings. The files are installed to the `$CLUSTER_NAME/` folder.
   ```
   cd $CLUSTER_NAME
   ```

3. Initialize the project
   ```
   make init
   ```

4. Build the docker container
   ```
   make docker:build
   ```    

5. Install the wrapper shell
   ```
   make install
   ```

6. Run the shell: `/usr/local/bin/$CLUSTER_NAME`

## Creating a Kops Cluster

Create your `kops` cluster from a manifest. The manifest template is located in `/templates/kops/default.yaml` and is compiled by running `build-kops-manifest`.

After building the manifest, create the cluster by running and following the resultant instructions.
   ```
   kops create -f /conf/kops/manifest.yml
   ```  

All done. Your cloud is now up and running.
