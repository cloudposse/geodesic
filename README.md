## Introduction

Geodesic is the fastest way to get up and running with a rock solid, production grade cloud platform. 

It provides a fully customizable framework for defining and building world-class cloud infrastructures backed by [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and powered by [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). It couples best-of-breed technologies with engineering best-practices to equip organizations with the tooling that enables clusters to be spun up in record time without compromising security.

Geodesic is composed of two parts:

1. It is an interactive command-line shell. The shell includes the *ultimate* mashup of cloud orchestration tools. Those tools are then integrated to work in concert with each other using a consistent framework. Installation of the shell is as easy as running a docker container.  
2. It is a distribution of essential services. The distribution includes a collection of Helm charts for CI/CD, VPN, SSH Bastion, Automatic DNS, Automatic TLS,  Automatic Monitoring, Account Management, Log Collection, Load Balancing/Routing, Image Serving, and much more. What makes these charts even more valuable is that they were designed from the ground up work well with each other and integrate with external services for authentication (SSO/OAuth2, MFA).

An organization may chose to leverage all of these components, or just the parts the make their life easier.

## Features
* **Secure** - TLS/PKI, OAuth2, MFA Everywhere, remote access VPN, [ultra secure bastion/jumphost](https://github.com/cloudposse/bastion) with audit capabilities and slack notifications, [IAM assumed roles](https://github.com/cloudposse/aws-assume-role/), automatic key rotation, encryption at rest, and VPCs;
* **Repeatable** - 100% Infrastructure-as-Code with change automation and support for scriptable admin tasks in any language, including terraform;
* **Extensible** - A framework where everything can be be extended to work the way you want to to;
* **Comprehensive** - our [helm charts library](https://github.com/cloudposse/charts) are designed to tightly integrate your cloud-platform with Github Teams and Slack Notifications and CI/CD systems like TravisCI, CircleCI or Jenkins;
* **OpenSource** - Permissive [APACHE 2.0](LICENSE) license means no lock-in and no on-going license fees


## Technologies

At its core, Geodesic is a framework for provisioning cloud infrastructure and the applications that sit on top of it. We leverage as many existing tools as possible to facilitate cloud fabrication and administration. We're like the connective tissue that sits between all of the components of a modern cloud.

* [`kops`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/) for kubernetes cluster orchestration 
* [`aws-cli`](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/) for interacting directly with the AWS APIs
* [`helm`](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/) for installing packages like varnish or apache on the kubernetes cluster
* [`terraform`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/) for provisioning miscellaneous resources on pretty much any cloud
* [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl-overview/) for controlling kubernetes resources like deployments or load balancers
* [`s3fs`](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse) for mounting encrypted S3 buckets that store cluster configurations and secrets
* [`hub`](https://github.com/github/hub) for managing your infrastructure-as-code on Github - the way you can extend geodesic to do pretty much anything you want

## Prerequisites

### Install Docker

Docker can be easily installed by following the instructions for your OS:

* [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/linux/step_one/) (Or simply run  `curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh`)
* [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/windows/step_one/)
* [Mac OS](https://docs.docker.com/mac/step_one/)

## Quick Start

1. Install the geodesic client, if you haven't already: (feel free to inspect the shell script!)

   ```
   curl -s https://geodesic.sh | bash
   ```
2. Run `geodesic` to start the geodesic shell
3. Run `setup-role` to configure your AWS credentials
4. Run `assume-role $role` where $role is the one you configured in your AWS configuration.
5. Run `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa` to add your ssh key to the SSH agent (must be same key used on Github)
5. Run `cloud create` to run through configuration steps
6. Run `cloud up` to provision the cluster

All done. Your cloud is now up and running.
