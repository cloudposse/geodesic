# Files in the profile.d directory are executed by the lexicographical order of their file names.
# This file is named _30-geodesic-config.sh. The leading underscore is needed to ensure this file
# executes before other files that depend on the functions defined here.
# The number portion is to ensure proper ordering among the high-priority scripts.
# This file defines functions but does not execute them, so it can come anywhere
# before the first script to use one of its functions, such as preferences.sh.

# bash functions that support the user customization framework
#
# Given the name of a resource, _search_geodesic_dirs assembles an array of matching, Geodesic-specific resources,
# in order from most general to most specific. They should be applied in order with the later ones overriding
# the earlier ones.
#
# Every resource, for example "preferences", can be either a file or a directory.
# * If it is a file, it is loaded directly
# * If it is a directory, all the non-hidden files in that directory are loaded in glob sort order
#
# Several directories are searched for resources, in this order:
# * $base/defaults/ ($base itself defaults to /localhost/.geodesic, can be set via GEODESIC_CONFIG_HOME)
# * $base/ if and only if there is no $base/defaults/ directory
# * $base/$(dirname $DOCKER_IMAGE)/defaults/
# * $base/$(dirname $DOCKER_IMAGE)/ if and only if there is no $base/$(dirname $DOCKER_IMAGE)/defaults/ directory
# * $base/$(base $DOCKER_IMAGE)/
# * $base/$DOCKER_IMAGE/
#
# Usage: _search_geodesic_dirs array-ref resource-name
# The first argument to _search_geodesic_dirs is the name of a variable. That variable will be treated as an array
# and all the files found will be added in the order described above. The second argument is the name of the resource
# See example usages in _preferences.sh
